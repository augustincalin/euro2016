<h2>How can you gain <span class="coin-small"></span><span class="coin-small"></span><span class="coin-small"></span> and became famous?</h2>
<p>Easy: If you guess the result (1, X or 2) you get 3<span class="coin-small"></span>. If you guess the number of goals a team scores you receive 1<span class="coin-small"></span>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let's suppose Denmark is playing against Greece and you estimate <b>Denmark - Greece will be 2 : 1</b>.</p>
<p>If the real score is...</p>

<p><b>Denmark - Greece 2 : 1</b> - In this case you will get 3<span class="coin-small"></span> for identifying the winner <b>+</b> 1<span class="coin-small"></span> for guessing the number of goals Denmark scores <b>+</b> 1<span class="coin-small"></span> for guessing the number of goals Greece scores. That's 5<span class="coin-small"></span> in total.</p>

<p><b>Denmark - Greece 2 : 0</b> - You will receive 3<span class="coin-small"></span> for correctly identifying the winner <b>+</b> 1<span class="coin-small"></span> point for guessing the number of goals Denmark scores. Total: 4<span class="coin-small"></span>.</p>

<p><b>Denmark - Greece 1 : 1</b> - You will receive only 1<span class="coin-small"></span> for guessing the number of goals Greece scores.</p>

<p><b>Denmark - Greece 5 : 2</b> - In this case you will receive 3<span class="coin-small"></span> for guessing the winner.</p>

<p><b>Denmark - Greece 1 : 2</b> - In this case you will receive 0,-<span class="coin-small"></span>. You guessed nothing, you receive nothing!</p>
<h3>The workflow</h3>
<p>You can bet on any further match. You can change your bet any time for a further match. Obviously you can't change a bet for a match that already started. Alexander, don't even try it! Once the match started, that's it, you can't bet on it.</p>
<p>The numbers are updated after each game except when I'm on support rota. In such case a slight delay may occur.</p>
