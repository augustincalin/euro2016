<h2>How can you gain <span class="coin-small"></span><span class="coin-small"></span><span class="coin-small"></span> and became famous?</h2>
<p>Easy:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let's suppose Denmark is playing against Greece and you estimate <b>Denmark - Greece will be 2 : 1</b>.</p>
<p>If the real score is...</p>

<h4>Denmark - Greece 2 : 1</h4>
<p>In this case you will get: 3<span class="coin-small"></span> for identifying the winner + 1<span class="coin-small"></span> for guessing the number of goals Denmark scores + 1<span class="coin-small"></span> for guessing the number of goals Greece scores. That's 5<span class="coin-small"></span> in total.</p>

<h4>Denmark - Greece 2 : 0</h4>
<p>You will receive 3<span class="coin-small"></span> for correctly identifying the winner + 1<span class="coin-small"></span> point for guessing the number of goals Denmark scores. Total: 4<span class="coin-small"></span>.</p>

<h4>Denmark - Greece 1 : 1</h4>
<p>You will receive only 1<span class="coin-small"></span> for guessing the number of goals Greece scores.</p>

<h4>Denmark - Greece 5 : 2</h4>
<p>In this case you will receive 3<span class="coin-small"></span> for guessing the winner.</p>

<h4>Denmark - Greece 1 : 2</h4>
<p>In this case you will receive 0,-<span class="coin-small"></span>. You guessed nothing, you receive nothing!</p>
